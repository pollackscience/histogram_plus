Features
========

The `histogram_plus` package includes all available features from the `matplotlib` implementation
of `plt.hist`, and adds many new and useful additions.  While these additions are motivated by
common use-cases typically seen in High Energy Physics, they can be useful for any individual who
wants improved visualization and analysis methods for histograms.

The following additional features are included in this package:
#. Bayesian Blocks binning algorithm.
#. Automatic errorbar calculation.
#. Marker draw-style.
#. Improved scaling.
#. Methods for visualizing the difference between two histograms via ratio.
